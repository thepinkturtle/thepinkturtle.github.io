The Helix. More keys, more lights and more fun! This was a fun build because I had half the parts I already needed. 

I tried building this board awhile back. But the PCB I was supplied with had bad traces and it resulted in a few broken keys. I had a more self inflicted problem like that on my Levinson. However, I was able to fix that with some good old fashioned hand wiring. I didn’t want to do that on my old Helix build so I trashed it.

I did make one mistake and that was desoldering all the old WS2812B LEDs from my old board. At the time, I didn’t want to spend the extra $30 to buy 70 LEDs. I chose poorly. It would have saved me countless hours and working with angry solder, because the temperature has to be relatively low on these LEDs, so as to not burn them out.

I put gateron black silence switches in and I like them a lot! They have a really nice subtle, due to the silent option, clunk to them.

The keyscaps aren’t perfect yet. I ran out of the blue ones and threw an old blue one I had laying around from my Levinson build. I got the caps from PimpMyKeyboard. They have great coloring, dye sublimated legends and are true to colors posted on their website too. Couldn’t be happier.

All and all, I like this board a lot. It was a fun build that I had some unfinished business with from the past broken PCB build. I finally got that itch out of my system. I still have one more dream build in my system though. The keyword is, wireless.
