The Helix. More keys, more lights and more fun! This was a great build because I had half the parts I already needed. 

I tried building this board a while back. But the PCB had bad traces, which resulted in a few broken keys. I had a more self inflicted problem like that on my Levinson. However, I was able to fix that with some good old fashioned hand wiring. I didn’t want to do that on my old Helix so I trashed it and built this new one!

I did make one big mistake during this build, and that was desoldering all the old WS2812B LEDs from my old board. At the time, I didn’t want to spend the extra $30 to buy the additional 20 LEDs. I thought It'd be easy enough to desolder the old LEDs and reuse them on this board. I chose poorly. It would have saved me countless hours working with angry solder, because the temperature has to be relatively low on these LEDs. Or else, they'll burn out.

I used gateron black silence switches in and I like them a lot! They have a really nice subtle, due to the silent option, chonk to them. Also, this board features hotswappable switcheds and microcontrollers. If I ever need to replace the microcontrollers I can just pop them off. The USB connector on them is known to break off. In fact, this happened on one of my other boards and I ended up having to desolder the microcontroller and it was a nightware.

The keyscaps aren’t perfect yet. I ran out of the blue ones and threw an old blue one I had laying around from my Levinson build. I got the caps from PimpMyKeyboard. They have great coloring, dye sublimated legends and are true to colors posted on their website too. Couldn’t be happier.

All and all, I like this board a lot. It was a fun build that I had some unfinished business with from the past broken PCB build. I finally got that itch out of my system. I still have one more dream build in my system though. The keyword is, wireless.
