### About me
I run this site with Github Pages and Jekyll. I'm a software engineer and Data Scientist. I like exploring data and seeing what I can find. I use python, AWS sagemaker and Tableau for the majority of my insights.

On my days off you can find me mountain biking, road cycling, book reading, building custom mechanical keyboards, backpacking, mountain climbing and social distancing. To name a few things.
