title: Evolution makes you feel like crap.
---

I had taken a Bio Informatics course during my Master's, and it dealt with DNA, genes and all that stuff.
<br/>During that time, I read somewhere that polar bears actually didn't start out that way, but evolved because being white camouflaged them on the ice and gave an advantage while hunting, so subsequently all bears in those regions evolved that way. 
<br/>
It reminded me of a story I heard when I was really young, something about rats getting immune to disease though evolution. 

I got to thinking, and a chain of thought was floating in my head that if someone wills hard over generations they evolve to gain advantage. So, I was wondering if the evolution takes place in the tiniest steps every generation.
<br/>
I was asking project mates from the Bio informatics course about polar bears, how they knew white gave an advantage over other colors, that they eventually evolved into full blown whites. I was wondering that maybe color faded slowly into white every generation as they evolved.
<br/>
Boy, was I wrong. I thought we controlled evolution.
I was discussing the same with Mag a couple of years later, and he suggested that maybe the ones that didn't evolve simply died. That made so much sense. 

And it was a slow burn that was smoldering in my head, till I came to terms with it: we're not the champions of evolution, but merely the byproducts. That just broke me. I had a false sense of control and pride about the achievements of us, as mankind. We made it this far with our superiority, right?

# A Thought Experiment:
Take a hypothetical population of 3 legged stick figures filling up a hypothetical planet. Let's say the planet had a periodical cycle of strong winds that wipe out whoever does not hang on to the trees.
<br/>
Now, what I thought was, the stick men would know about this and deepdown inside their heads an idea would be born, that having an extra leg would give them an unprecedented advantage over nature. So, that idea after several generations would eventually transform into the Stick men developing a fourth leg.
<br/>
Okay, I know, this sounds stupid now. But, that was my understanding for years.

# The Reality
Reproduction is often imperfect, and mutations are unavoidable. We do see people with 6 fingers, and animals with other weird genetic mutations.
Let's say about three Stick men develop a genetic mutation in a generation giving them 4 legs. The wind comes and goes, and these 3 are left alive. Being living things, they mate and give rise to 8 more little Stick men. And they dont' turn back from that point. Whoever isn't mutated does not make it long.
<br/>
So, there it is, we're the leftovers, the lucky ones. The praying mantis thats the color of the leaves didn't get there by will, but rather by process of elimination. We didn't evolve intelligently to walk on 2 legs, it's just that these 2 legged people had a higher survival rate, and they eventually outnumbered the other ones.

Basically, we're trash that nature hasn't thrown out yet. 
Evolution isn't an intelligent, sophisticated machine. It is brute force.
