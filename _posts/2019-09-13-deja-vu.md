I feel like I've lived this moment a thousand times before.
<br/>Exactly the same. The same scene in front of my eyes. The same music playing in my head.
<br/>The ambience. The visceral feeling.
<br/>Like I've been ushered back in time to do something differently.
<br/>To observe what I didn't before. Maybe change someone's fate.
<br/>'Come on, change the perspective. React differently. Think. Now...'
<br/>
But before I get back to my senses,I see that I've lost it.
<br/>The fleeting Invincibility I felt is gone in a snap.
<br/>But the impact of the revelation hasn't weathered away yet. I can still feel the adrenaline induced organs crying out loud in ecstasy. Begging me to act.
<br/>But my mind's numb. Still in shock. I had one simple chance, and I ruined it.
<br/>Change the timeline, huh? More like a Sphere.
<br/>Deja vu,I guess.
<br/> Time loops repeatedly till you do what you're destined to. Make the right choice.
<br/>Push forward.
