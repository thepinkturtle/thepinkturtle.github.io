  <h1> I'm Devin LaCrosse</h1>
  <br/>If you've made it here, you're awesome.
  <br/>I'm a curious soul always learning about technology and Data Science.
  <br/>I have too many hobbies which include, but are not limited to, mountain biking, road cycling, book reading, building custom mechanical keyboards, backpacking, mountain climbing, social distancing (I was doing this before it was the all rage).
